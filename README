Ubuntu Installation Instructions:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:v-launchpad-jochen-sprickerhof-de/pcl
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake freeglut3-dev libopencv-dev python-opencv libpcl-all libnoise-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcurlpp-dev parallel

git clone https://gitlab.com/rusen/Grasp.git
cd Grasp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../mjpro150
make

# Running the program
Dropbox folder sharing invitations should be accepted (shared separately). This is how the program can be run:

cd ../mjpro150/bin
screen ./runGrasp.sh <number of processes> <Dropbox folder>

The script runs <number of processes> simultaneous processes at once. An example run is:

screen ./runGrasp.sh 4 /home/username/Dropbox

# Misc
For Ubuntu 14.04, a number higher than 4 is causing crashes, hence a maximum number of 4 is recommended. For Mac, one can go higher. 

After running the above command, press (ctrl + a) , then (d) to leave screen window, and type (screen -x) to revisit the window later.
To stop processing, you can go to the screen window by typing (screen -x) and pressing (ctrl + c). If the child processes do not stop, you can kill them all by typing:

killall -v basicGrasp 

The computer should be connected to the internet at all times. MUjoco grasp simulation uses Dropbox to access another machine in Birmingham, where point clouds are processed to obtain trajectories. The resulting log data is sent to an AWS machine, and is not kept locally after that. In case this server is down, the files are saved under mjpro/bin/tmp.
